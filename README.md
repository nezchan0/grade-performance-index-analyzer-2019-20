# Result Analysis (Class 12 Project – 2019)
**Status:** *Archived – legacy school project*

This repository contains my Class 12 Computer Science final project, originally built in **2019**.  
I am publishing it now purely for **archival and learning history purposes**.  
My current projects on GitHub reflect my modern coding skills — this one is preserved as a meaningful milestone.

## 📘 **Project Overview**

This application performs **Result Analysis** for a class based on grade distributions across subjects.  
It calculates:

- Total grade counts  
- Weighted grade scores  
- **Performance Index (PI)** for each subject  
- Overall class PI  
- A bar graph of PI vs Subject  

The tool was built using:

- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

## 🎓 **Background & Context**

In my Class 12 Computer Science curriculum (2019), we were required to build a final-year project.  
My teacher specifically asked me to create a **Result Analysis tool** that could automate the calculation of  
Performance Index and other metrics used by teachers at the end of every academic year.

At that time:

- Many teachers struggled with Excel formulas while computing these statistics.  
- No ready-made projects of this type were available online.  
- AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini did not exist — everything had to be thought through manually.

I built this project **entirely from scratch**, using the inputs, logic, and calculation methods provided by my teacher.

After I completed the application, my school teachers actually started using it.  
Seeing something I built being used by others gave me an intense sense of satisfaction —  
it was the moment I truly realized the **joy of creating software that helps real people**.  

That experience played a major role in inspiring me to choose **Computer Science** as my bachelor's degree.

## 🗂️ **Why this repository is archived**

This project represents my early coding journey (2019).  
I am archiving it to preserve it as a **legacy educational project** — not as an example of my current coding practices.

My newer and more advanced projects are available on my GitHub profile.
